As first Full Stack Project, create a user-friendly GUI library web application containing all media such as (books, CDs, DVDs).

## TASK DESCRIPTION

1. At first create a database with columns named title,image,ISBN code,short-description,type(book,CDs,DVD),author_name, publisher_name,publisher_address,publish_date.
   
2. Display List of Media: Fetch the media data from your database and display it on the browser.

3. Create a form for Media. A user should be able to insert data into the database over the front-end form.

4. You should create a button "Show details", that will be displayed together with every Media shown on the list. Once the button is clicked, all details regarding that specific Media (title, author, ISBN, short_description, status) will be displayed on a new webpage. In order to do that, a new file: details.php must be used.
   
5. Create a new file and name it publisher.php. When clicking on the publisher's name on the index.html it should link the user to publisher.php and bring all media pubblished by that specific publisher only.

6. Allow users to search for media by title or author, adding a simple search form on the index page and handling the search on the server side.
